   - Silence ratio (simplified metric)  
   - Clarity score (simplified metric)

3. **Developmental Assessment**  
   - Provides basic guidance on speech development: normal, slightly delayed, or requires attention.

4. **Therapy Recommendations**  
   - Suggests exercises or monitoring strategies based on speech clarity and duration.
